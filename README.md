This program generates a rotating 3D cube using ASCII characters in a terminal window. It demonstrates basic 3D projection and rotation concepts.

## Prerequisites

- C/C++ Compiler
- Terminal/Command Prompt

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C/C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable in your terminal.

The program will create a window displaying a rotating cube made of ASCII characters.
